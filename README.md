# College Clubs Backend

This is a partial implementation of the API for our final project for Diseño de Sistemas. This repo contains the code of the Express API that will expose certain endpoints notably to get access to our system's main entities.

## Dependency Installation

In order to run this API you'll need to install the required dependencies with:

```text
npm install
```

Or in production with a frozen lock file with:

```text
npm ci
```

## Configuration

You'll need to either set the following environment variables or create a `.env` file with the following:

```text
HTTP_PORT=4000
```

## Running

If in development, you can run the server with reload-on-save with:

```text
npm run dev
```

If in production, you can run the server with:

```text
npm start
```

## Endpoint Documentation

WIP.

## Authors

This project was created in pair-programming by Raí Díaz, José Luis Contreras and Christian López.
